<h2>about Rain</h2>
<p>Then came 'Rain'. It was the first song I made in wich all instruments are ZynnAddSubFX, and also the first song in wich I made the instruments myself. This was because I had learned the basics of ZynnAddSubFX shortly before. First I exported it as loop, as it sounds really good as loop in LMMS, I had even done some things to make the ending connect better to the beginning. So I exported it, and didn't listen to the result and uploaded it to soundcloud. Later, when I had tried to listen to it as a loop in soundcloud it turned out that that didn't sound good at all. The problem was that I had used reverb. The reverb from the end could still be heard in LMMS when it continued back to the beginning, but (of course) as an audiofile it was not. For the export, lmms had cut out the reverb at the end because it was a loop, so it sounded bad even as a non-loop, so I exported it not as a loop, and reuploaded it. Anyway, on to the next song, and that was Science Fiction. </p>
