			<h2>History </h2>
			<div class="history">
				<div class="1"><p>In  Januari 2021, I downloaded <a href=https://lmms.org>LMMS</a> as I wanted to make the music for the shortfilm I tried to make in <a href=https://blender.org/>Blender</a>. I tried some things out, but I thought I wasn't really good enough in making music to make the music for the shortfilm. </p></div>
				<div class="empty"></div>
				<div class="2"><p>In February a friend let me hear music he made, and asked if he could hear some music I made, as he didn't know that I kind of stopped trying to make music, wich I said, but he convinced me to give it one more try. </div>
				<div class="empty"></div>
				<div class="3"><p>So first I made something I didn't find good enough to post it online, and later I made <a href=https://soundcloud.com/0101010001000100/somewhere-in-the-universe>'Somewhere In The Universe'</a> wich was surprisingly good, so I started making more and the next song was The Fox. </p></div>
				<div class="link"><p><a href=https://soundcloud.com/0101010001000100/somewhere-in-the-universe>Link to the song on Soundcloud </p></div>
				<div class="4"><p>The fox was, to my opinion, less good, although it was much more rhythmic than Somewhere In The Universe. </p></div>
				<div class="link"><p><a href=https://soundcloud.com/0101010001000100/the-fox>Link to the song on Soundcloud </p></div>
				<div class="5"><p>After that came The big day, it was short, and wasn't that good, but I like the melody. </p></div>
				<div class="link"><p><a href=https://soundcloud.com/tibbemusic/the-big-day>Link to the song on Soundcloud </p></div>
				<div class="6"><p>Then Came 'Is that A Gun?' wich I made with Qinkiebinkie. It wasn't that good to my opinion, but I blame the coronavirus, because working on the same music at the same time with someone, that doesn't work well online. We used Teams' screen-sharing feature, and Quinten (qinkiebinkie) had given access to his screen. You can imagine that won't be a success, especially with Teams' snail speed. </p></div>				
				<div class="link"><p><a href=https://soundcloud.com/qinkiebinkie/qinkiebinkie-tibbe_debats-is-that-a-gun>Link to the song on Soundcloud </p></div>
				<div class="7"><p>After that came 'The Vulcanic Island'. The chords were bad, but I didn't had much experience using chords. </p></div>
				<div class="link"><p><a href=https://soundcloud.com/tibbemusic/the-vulcanic-island>Link to the song on Soundcloud </p></div>
				<div class="8"><p>After that I made something with Qinkiebinkie again called 'Near The End', wich we also made using MS Teams. We started with both of us doing stuff everywhere, but later, we decided that we could better go further with both of us one half of the music (I did the last part). </p></div>
				<div class="link"><p><a href=https://soundcloud.com/qinkiebinkie/qinkiebinkie-tibbe_debats-near-the-end>Link to the song on Soundcloud </p></div>				
				<div class="9"><p>After that, I made my first remix. I remixed Qinkiebinkies The Binky, but I didn't asked for the files of the original (the original wasn't made in lmms), and I was too lazy to sample anything, so I made something totally different, but I used 2 melodies of The Binky. </p></div>
				<div class="link"><p><a href=https://soundcloud.com/tibbemusic/the-binky-remake_remix>Link to the song on Soundcloud </p></div>
				<div class="10"><p>I made another remix of one of Qinkiebinkies songs, this time 'U'. This time I had the mmpz file of the original, so it was a lot more easy. I added FX, and I added a lot of small changes, because at first there was a lot of exactly the same thing in a row. </p></div>
				<div class="link"><p><a href=https://soundcloud.com/tibbemusic/qinkiebinkie-u-remix>Link to the song on Soundcloud </p></div>				
				<div class="11"><p>Then I made, together with Qinkiebinkie (I should have learned that working together via teams, just doesn't work), a new song wich we called 'The Forest'. Quinten wanted vocals, and I didn't. Eventually I agreed to vocals, since it's a matter of give and take. </p></div>
				<div class="link"><p><a href=https://soundcloud.com/tibbemusic/tibbe-qinkiebinkie-the-forest>Link to the song on Soundcloud </p></div>
				<div class="12"><p>Then I thought it was time again to really make something myself again, so I made 'Watt'. My best description of it is "Much the same, but varied". </p></div>
				<div class="link"><p><a href=https://soundcloud.com/tibbemusic/watt>Link to the song on Soundcloud </p></div>
				<div class="13"><p>Later I tried to make a clarinet in TripleOscillator, but I wasn't sure how realistic it sounds as it was a long time ago that i played clarinet. I used it for Moonshine. Moonshine has just two instruments, both a clarinet, as I wanted to make something for clarinet, so I could play it in real life. Moonshine was way too loud as I didn't normalize the audio before uploading, and know I think I should have used more different instruments than 2 clarinets. </p></div>
				<div class="link"><p><a href=https://soundcloud.com/tibbemusic/moonshine>Link to the song on Soundcloud </p></div>
				<div class="14"><p>After that came 120. 120 was named after it being 120 BPM (I didn't had a good idea for the name). 120 was slow, but I liked, and still like it. It was the first song in wich I used ZynnAddSubFX, altough just presets. </p></div>
				<div class="link"><p><a href=https://soundcloud.com/tibbemusic/120-one-hundred-twenty>Link to the song on Soundcloud </p></div>
				<div class="15"><p>Then came 'Rain'. It was the first song I made in wich all instruments are ZynnAddSubFX, and also the first song in wich I made the instruments. This was because I had learned the basics of ZynnAddSubFX shortly before. First I exported it as loop, as it sounds really good as loop in LMMS, I had even done some things to make the ending connect better to the beginning. So I exported it, and didn't listen to the result and uploaded it to soundcloud. Later, when I had tried to listen to it as a loop in soundcloud it turned out that that didn't sound good at all. The problem was that I had used reverb. The reverb from the end could still be heard in LMMS when it continued back to the beginning, but (of course) as an audiofile it was not. For the export, lmms had cut out the reverb at the end because it was a loop, so it sounded bad even as a non-loop, so I exported it not as a loop, and reuploaded it. Anyway, on to the next song, and that was Science Fiction. </p></div>

				<div class="16"><p>Science Fiction was a lot faster than the previous two songs, and sounds very enthausiastic. I first tried to make a Progressive House loop along the lines of <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwNeg56HMpVktOvbSLOKzXA>a tutorial from Anthony's Tune</a> and I had worked that out to a song. </p></div>
