			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hi, I am Tibbe. I am quite an introvert. One of my biggest hobby's is to make music. The software I use for that is a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) called LMMS. What I also like is working on my (this) website, especially the web design part. <a href="music/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here you can listen to my music.</a></p>
			
			<h2>What this site is for.</h2>
			<p>One of the things you can do on this site, is listening to my music. Of course you can also listen to my music on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/0101010001000100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Soundcloud</a>, Soundcloud works fine, but this way I can practice building websites, and matters it not as much, if Soundcloud changes something that sucks. </p>
