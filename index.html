<h2>about me</h2>
<p>Hi, I am Tibbe. My biggest hobby is making music. The software I use for that is a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) called <a href="https://lmms.io">LMMS</a>, but in the future I might be using <a href="https://ardour.org">Ardour</a> or <a href="http://www.reaper.fm/">Reaper</a>. </p>

<h2>the story</h2>
<p>I started making music begin this year (2021) (for everyone in 2025 or later, corona was still a thing back then), with a free and open source daw called LMMS. I found out about that daw when I was attempting to make a shortfilm in <a href="https://blender.org">Blender</a> (wich failed) and i wanted to make the music myself. I didn't really know how to make music back then, but as I was still learning blender, the shortfilm failed, and thus I never tried making the music. I think a few months later I heard from a friend that he was making music, so I also started making music and my first song was born. </p>
